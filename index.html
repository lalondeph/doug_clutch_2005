	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<p><span class="doug">Doug</span> is the son of an Amish farmer and a local radio personality. Raised by his maternal method-acting grandparents, creation is in his blood. <span class="doug">Doug</span> began his artistic pursuits as a toddler writing on whatever he could find, with anything that would stick to it. 
	</p>
	<p>A late bloomer, <span class="doug">Doug</span> was silent until his fifth birthday. To this day he prefers to communicate through his art.  <span class="doug">Doug</span> won his first art contest at the age of 3 and has never looked back. 
	</p>
	<p>This gallery is meant to showcase the modern view of <span class="doug">Doug Clutch</span>, as a man and an artist. It will also serve as a platform for commissions, critical feedback, and as an online store.
	</p>
